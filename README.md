## LillyBelle and Marc Tie the Knot!

I'm Marc Blumberg and this is a website for my wedding with LillyBelle Deer!

And that's about all you need to know!

You can see it at [lillybelleandmarc.com](lillybelleandmarc.com).

For those interested in the development side of things, I built it in React. I partially used [React Suite](https://rsuitejs.com/) for some UI components. For hosting I deployed to [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). Then for the custom domain I purchased one from [Domain.com](https://www.domain.com/) and configured Firebase to point at my custom domain.
